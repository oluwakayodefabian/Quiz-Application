The logic for the Quiz app has been created using JS.
Now, i want to make changes to it, i want to connect the quiz app to server-side language called PHP and save:

- Firstly, the total score of each user in a database table.
- Later on maybe fetch the questions from a table as well with different categories where the users can pick the kind of categories of topics they like and questions for that topic will be shown to them.
- And also add authentication, the user that wants to take take a quiz should have an account before they can take an exam.
