# A MINI QUIZ APPLICATION

In this quiz app, I used new ES6 features like the spred operator, let, const, arrow functions and other JS features as well. I made use of array functions like splice and map. I also made use of the local storage to store data like the user's score.
In the CSS, I used things like flexbox/grid for layouts, animations, rem units, etc.
In summary all these were used to create the quiz application.
